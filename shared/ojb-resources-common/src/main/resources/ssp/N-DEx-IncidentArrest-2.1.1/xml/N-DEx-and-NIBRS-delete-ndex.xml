	Document: $Id: N-DEx-and-NIBRS-delete.xml  $
	Original : 07/23/2009
	Updated : 5/14/2010 - Updated N-DEx version number in header to 2.1.1
	LEXS version : 3.1.4
	N-DEx version : 2.1.1
	Description : This scenario represents an N-DEx submission designed to remove Data Item data previously submitted to N-DEx and extracted for NIBRS submission.  
			The scenario builds upon the N-DEx-delete.xml sample to illustrate the added structure and contents of a submission needed to remove data previously extracted 
			to NIBRS.  Such a submission would result in the deletion the N-DEx Data Item as well as the the NIBRS Data Item.  

			Sample files that end in "-lexs.xml" only include content from the LEXS schemas; the Structured Payload only contains metadata and an empty Report element.  
			These instances can be validated against the LEXS publish-discover.xsd schema.  The files that end in "-ndex.xml" only include content from the N-DEx 
			schemas; each only includes a single N-DEx report element.  These instances can be validated against the N-DEx ndexia.xsd schema.  The remaining files 
			illustrate a complete N-DEx submission that includes both "layers" combined into a single instance.  These instances can be validated against the LEXS 
			publish-discover.xsd schema, but such validation will ignore everything in the Structured Payload except for the metadata; validation will check that the 
			Structured Payload data is well-formed XML, but nothing more.
