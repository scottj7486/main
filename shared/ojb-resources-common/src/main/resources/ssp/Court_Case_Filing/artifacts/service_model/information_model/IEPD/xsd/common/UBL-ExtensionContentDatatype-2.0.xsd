  OASIS takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
  intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to pertain 
  to the implementation or use of the technology described in this 
  document or the extent to which any license under such rights 
  might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it has 
  made any effort to identify any such rights. Information on OASIS's 
  procedures with respect to rights in OASIS specifications can be 
  found at the OASIS website. Copies of claims of rights made 
  available for publication and any assurances of licenses to be made 
  available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a general 
  license or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by 
  implementors or users of this specification, can be obtained from 
  the OASIS Executive Director.

  OASIS invites any interested party to bring to its attention any 
  copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary 
  rights which may cover technology that may be required to 
  implement this specification. Please address the information to the 
  OASIS Executive Director.
