			<outputDescription>Upon accepting a CJIS System Agency (CSA)'s request, an NGI Control Number (NCN) will be
				returned on this operation. This NCN can be used to correlate with
				an NGI response that is sent to the	corresponding requesting CSA in a separate response. The data
				element for the NCN can be found in the fbi_ngi_core.xsd.

			<preconditions>Authorized Contributor must have network access to a CJIS interface agency, which has made

			<effects>A transaction based on input provided will be
				performed. Upon completion, a separate corresponding
				response will be
				sent to the requesting CSA. Additionally, unsolicited notification(s)
				may be sent based on subjects hit and dissemination rules.

			<errors>If an NGI internal system error (such as a database is down,
				or an authorization has failed) has occurred prior to the NGI
				system's ability to process a submitted CSA's request, a SOAP fault
				with the error condition encountered will be thrown on the
				"submitRequest" operation. This indicates that the NGI system
				has not accepted the CSA's requests.

		<consumerPattern>
			<name>Request - Response.
				A typical pattern is as follows:
				1. A CSA initially submits a request and a
				NCN response is provided by NGI upon accepting the request.
				2. Upon completing a CSA's request, NGI
				will initiate another request/response with the CSA's implemented
				native EBTS response service to receive the response for
				the previously submitted request.</name>
