    <h3>Welcome to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) RAPUP tool.</h3>  
    <p>Complete and accurate criminal history records are a critical component in ensuring citizen safety and fairness, 
    not only within Oklahoma but throughout our entire country.  All too often, incomplete criminal history records 
    lead to mis-informed decisions related to sentencing, employment, licensure, firearm purchases and 
    other similar activities. </p>
    <p> Through this tool, agencies can identify arrests, in their jurisdiction, that are missing dispositions in OSBIâ€™s 
    criminal history records system. Agencies can then add dispositional information to such arrests.  Agencies can also 
    modify details of cases with deferred dispositions. </p>
    <p> If a given arrest already has a disposition in the OSBI criminal history system, that arrest may not be viewable 
    through this tool.  You can request the ability to view and edit such arrest records using the "Arrest Lookup" feature. </p> 
    <p>Please contact Felicia Jackson (<a href="mailto:Felicia.Jackson@osbi.ok.gov">Felicia.Jackson@osbi.ok.gov</a>) 
    with any questions or suggestions.</p>
